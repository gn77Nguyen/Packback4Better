<h2 style="color:black;"align="center">Why Do You Need To Sponsor Family?</h2>
<h3 style="color:black;"align="center"><small>Every day, too many kids go to school without proper access to healthy meals or any food at all. Some families rely on school breakfast and lunches to feed their kids, but what happens when they go home after school where they don't have access to proper nutrition? Our organization aims to help families access quality food, and guide parents to achieve nutritional stability in their children’s meals. With fuller and healthier diets children have more chances to succeed in school.</small></h3>
<hr align="center"width="50%">
<h2 style="color:black;"align="center">How Do We Sponsor Your Family?</h2>
<h3 style="color:black;"align="center"><small>By innovative technology, we would like to provide for your family our program called: Backpack for Better. The parents can go to our website www.backpackforbetter.com or download free app “B4B”. The program will help parents provide healthy meals for their children. Parents will have access to multiple pickup-drop-off locations, stop by and we’ll have a meal ready for them anytime. Moreover, we provide information for parents about locally available produce, coupons, and meal plans. Our information is open to all, we aim to provide easy and accessible recipes for even the most inexperienced cook.</small>

They always want sugary things, Backpacks for Better helped me find ways to feed my kids nutritious meals while they still enjoying the taste.

When my children were younger, their food was nothing but junk. It’s like junk food was the only stuff available to us that I could afford. I always thought it didn’t matter what they are eating as long as they were eating. My kids were gaining weight and seriously unhealthy. I have been using this program for 2 months, and thanks to this program I don’t have to worry every morning to think about what the next meals are gonna be. Love it.</em><b>(Katherine J.
